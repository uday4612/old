# Railway Reservation System

## Overview

Welcome to the Railway Reservation System project, developed by Uday Patel. This project aims to provide a basic platform for users to search for trains, check availability, and book tickets. As a web developer and designer, I've initiated this project with fundamental functionalities, with plans to expand it into a comprehensive railway reservation system in the future.

Stay tuned for updates and enhancements as I continue to develop and improve this system. Your support and feedback are highly appreciated!

- **Availability Check:** Check the availability of seats on selected trains for a specific date.
- **Ticket Booking:** Book tickets for desired trains based on availability.
